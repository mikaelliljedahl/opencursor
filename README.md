# opencursor
Purpose
OpenCursor is a lightweight, console-based assistant to help developers build and modify software projects using LLMs (Large Language Models).
The user navigates the file system interactively, selects files and directories, and communicates with an LLM through a visible WebView-based browser interface. 
But the user is assumed to use a real IDE next to this tool to handle the solution. This is just an add-on tool.

The long-term goal is that the tool itself should be good enough to create new versions of itself, e.g. extending the commands that the LLM can call back to the tool.
